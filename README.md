# üìò Dart CLI Project: Manage a Book Library

## üìù Project Description

This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) project written in Dart for managing a simple book library. Users can interact with the program via keyboard input to perform tasks such as:

- Displaying all books
- Adding a new book
- Editing book details
- Searching for books
- Deleting books

The goal of this project is to strengthen your understanding of core programming concepts through a practical and interactive application.

## üß† Skills and Knowledge Required

Before starting, make sure you're comfortable with the following Dart programming concepts:
-
- ‚úÖ **Variables** ‚Äî to store data like book titles, authors, and years.
- ‚úÖ **Loops** ‚Äî to iterate through book lists.
- ‚úÖ **Functions** ‚Äî to encapsulate logic for tasks (e.g., adding or deleting a book).
- ‚úÖ **Collections (e.g., List)** ‚Äî to manage the book library.
- ‚úÖ **Classes** ‚Äî to define a `Book` object with properties like `title`, `author`, and `year`.
- ‚úÖ **Exception Handling** ‚Äî to handle input errors and avoid program crashes.
- ‚úÖ **Conditionals** ‚Äî to manage logic like validating input or checking if a book exists.

## üõ† How the Project Works

1. **Running the Program**  
   When executed, the program displays a menu with available actions.

2. **User Input**  
   The user selects an action by typing its number (e.g., `1` for listing books).

3. **Processing the Request**  
   The program calls the appropriate function and may prompt the user for additional input.

4. **Adding a Book**  
   The user is prompted to enter a title, author, and publication year. The book is then added to the list.

5. **Listing Books**  
   All books in the library are displayed with their ID, title, author, and year.

6. **Editing a Book**  
   The user selects a book by ID and edits its details.

7. **Searching for a Book**  
   A keyword is used to search titles or author names. Matches are shown.

8. **Deleting a Book**  
   The user provides a book ID, and the book is removed.

9. **Exiting the Program**  
   The application terminates when the user selects the exit option.
